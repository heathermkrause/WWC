Description: Functions for Datassist's Knight Foundation project for weighting 
        crowd-sourced surveys. The weighting algorithm uses post-stratification 
        to weight survey results by age, gender, education, and race/ethnicity 
        and can work at the national, state, or county level of geography 
        (US only).
