\title{Simulate the true response to a yes/no response question in a given
population with specified opinions for sex, race/ethnicity, age, and 
geography}
\usage{
simulate_true_response_age(geovector, odds_geography, odds_sex,
  odds_raceethnicity, odds_age)
}
\arguments{
\item{geovector}{A vector of geographies specified as a two letter 
abbreviation or a 5-digit FIPS code. Each geography must be the entire U.S. 
(\code{US}) or a single state (for example, \code{TX} or \code{CA}) or a 
single county (for example, \code{49035}). For example, \code{c("TX", "UT")}.}

\item{odds_geography}{Numeric vector specifying the opinion odds of the 
survey respondents by geography in the same bins as \code{geovector}.}

\item{odds_sex}{Numeric vector specifying the opinion odds of the survey
respondents by sex in the order male, then female. For example, \code{c(0.8,
1.25)} means that men are 0.8 times as likely to approve the survey question
and women are 1.25 times as likely to approve the survey question.}

\item{odds_raceethnicity}{Numeric vector specifying the opinion odds of
the survey respondents by race/ethnicity in the order white alone, Hispanic 
or Latino, black alone, Asian alone, and other, for example, 
\code{c(0.2, 2, 2.5, 1, 1)}.}

\item{odds_age}{Numeric vector specifying the opinion odds of the
survey respondents by age in the following bins: under 18 years, 18 to 24 
years, 25 to 44 years, 45 to 64 years, 65 years and over, for example, 
\code{c(1, 0.5, 2, 2.5, 2.5)}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with 3 columns (\code{value}, \code{answer}, and 
\code{result}) that tabulates the true opinion on the yes/no question 
in the given population.
}

Simulate the true response to a yes/no response question in a given

geography
