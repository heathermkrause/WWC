\title{Simulate the true response to a yes/no response question in a given
geography with specified opinions for sex, race/ethnicity, and education}
\usage{
simulate_true_response_education(geographyfetch, weight_sex,
  weight_raceethnicity, weight_education)
}
\arguments{
\item{geographyfetch}{A geography created with the \code{geo.make()} function
of the acs package. The geography must be the entire U.S. or a single state
or a single county.}

\item{weight_sex}{Numeric vector specifying the opinion weights of the survey
respondents by sex in the order male, then female. For example, \code{c(0.8,
1.25)} means that men are 0.8 times as likely to approve the survey question
and women are 1.25 times as likely to approve the survey question.}

\item{weight_raceethnicity}{Numeric vector specifying the opinion weights of
the survey respondents by race/ethnicity in the order white alone, Hispanic 
or Latino, black alone, Asian alone, and other, for example, 
\code{c(0.2, 2, 2.5, 1, 1)}.}

\item{weight_education}{Numeric vector specifying the opinion weights of the 
survey respondents by educational attainment in the following bins: less than 
high school diploma, high school graduate (includes equivalency), some 
college or associate's degree, bachelor's degree or higher, for example, 
\code{c(0.4, 0.5, 2, 2.5)}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with 3 columns (\code{value}, \code{answer}, and 
\code{result}) that tabulates the true opinion on the yes/no question 
in the given geography.
}
\description{
